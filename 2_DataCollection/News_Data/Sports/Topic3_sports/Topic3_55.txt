Credit Carlos Osorio/Associated Press     Ketel Marte and Brandon Drury homered in a three-run sixth inning to bolster a strong outing by Zack Godley, and the Arizona Diamondbacks extended their winning streak to 10 games with a 5-1 victory on Sunday over the Colorado Rockies in Denver. The streak is the Diamondbacks’ longest since they captured a franchise-best 12 straight in 2003. Godley (7-7) allowed three hits, walked six and struck out seven over six innings to help Arizona sweep a three-game series from the Rockies. The Diamondbacks increased their lead over Colorado for the top National League wild-card spot to six and a half games. The slumping Rockies’ lead over Milwaukee for the second wild card was trimmed to just a half-game. INDIANS’ RAMIREZ TIES A SLUGGING RECORD Jose Ramirez tied a major league record with five extra-base hits, including two home runs that deflected off Detroit outfielders, and the Cleveland Indians routed the Tigers, 11-1, in Detroit for their 11th straight victory. AROUND THE MAJORS Max Fried combined with four relievers on a five-hitter in his first major league start, and the Atlanta Braves ended the host Chicago Cubs’ six-game winning streak with a 5-1 victory.  Robinson Cano homered and drove in four runs, Andrew Albers took a no-hitter into the sixth inning, and the Seattle Mariners beat the visiting Oakland Athletics, 10-2, completing a three-game sweep.  Welington Castillo hit two home runs, including a game-tying shot in the ninth, and Mark Trumbo drove in the game-winning single in the 12th as the Baltimore Orioles rallied past the visiting Toronto Blue Jays, 5-4.

Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Leishman also played a bogey-free round and had three straight birdies on the back nine for a 65. They were at 12-under-par 201 with no room for error on a leaderboard that was packed with some of golf’s best players. Paul Casey, who played in the final group last year at TPC Boston, shot a 67 and was one shot behind. Jordan Spieth birdied his final two holes and was among those two shots back. Dustin Johnson, who birdied four of his final five holes, was three behind. LEWIS ENDS A SKID IN OREGON Stacy Lewis, who is from the Houston area, came through for her hurricane-ravaged hometown and ended a long winless streak, capturing the Cambia Portland Classic in Oregon. Lewis’s $195,000 in winnings will go to relief efforts, and her sponsor, KPMG, pledged to match the donation. Lewis, 32, won her 12th L.P.G.A. Tour title and her first since June 2014, ending a frustrating stretch that included 12 runner-up finishes. She closed with a three-under 69 to hold off In Gee Chun by a stroke at Columbia Edgewater.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL Another Newton, Another Upset Cam Newton is no longer the only quarterback in the family who has led a team to an improbable win. His younger brother Caylin made his college debut Saturday, leading Howard University to one of the biggest upsets in the sport’s history, a 43-40 victory at Nevada-Las Vegas. The Bison, a Football Championship Subdivision program, were 45-point underdogs against the Rebels.

PRO FOOTBALL Cleveland Unions Will Boycott Ceremony Members of unions representing Cleveland police officers and paramedics said they would not hold a large United States flag during ceremonies before Sunday’s Cleveland Browns season opener after a group of Browns players knelt during the national anthem before a preseason game last month. Nearly a dozen Browns players knelt in a circle and prayed silently during the anthem before a preseason home game Aug. 21 against the Giants. A smaller group of players placed hands on the shoulders of their kneeling teammates. JETS CLAIM EX-GIANTS TIGHT END Will Tye is switching uniforms and staying in the same home stadium. The Jets claimed Tye, a former Giants tight end, off waivers a day after N.F.L. teams trimmed their rosters from 90 to 53 players. The team also claimed wide receivers Damore’ea Stringfellow and Kalif Raymond and linebacker Edmond Robinson. It released linebacker Bruce Carter and waived linebacker Freddie Bishop, running back Marcus Murphy and tight end Jason Vander Laan.

Correction: September 6, 2017   An Associated Press report in the Scoreboard column on Monday about the golfer Stacy Lewis’s victory in the Cambia Portland Classic rendered incorrectly in some copies the name of her sponsor, which pledged to donate money to Hurricane Harvey relief efforts. It is KPMG, not KMPG.      A version of this article appears in print on September 4, 2017, on Page D6 of the New York edition with the headline: Baseball; Arizona Extends Streak and Wild-Card Edge.
