Sánchez poked the ball into the net from close range in the 12th minute and helped Jorge Valdívia score from the edge of the penalty area barely a minute later. But Australia recovered well, with forward Tim Cahill scoring on a header in the 35th minute, and gave the Chileans a string of scares in the second half. Jean Beausejour put the game away with a goal in injury time, and Chile moved into a tie atop Group B with the Netherlands , which thrashed Spain , 5-1, earlier Friday. Chile, which has been chosen by many, including Pelé, to go far in the tournament despite its tough group, will play Spain, the defending champion, on Wednesday.

He scored on Friday after Australia’s captain, Mile Jedinak, failed to head clear Charles Aránguiz’s cross.

But Chile’s momentum was punctured when Cahill, renowned for his jumping ability, leapt above the diminutive Gary Medel to thump home a header from a right-wing cross. “We knew we could get something out of this game,” Cahill, a Red Bulls star, said. “We stood up strong. It’s just unfortunate — not a lot went our way tonight.” Cahill squandered chances before and after halftime, and an offside call negated another fine header that went into the net.   The star midfielder Arturo Vidal started for Chile and played 59 minutes in his return from knee surgery. “He was very good,” Sampaoli said. “His knee is good.”   A version of this article appears in print on June 14, 2014, on Page D6 of the New York edition with the headline: With Fast Start, Chile Outpaces Australia.
