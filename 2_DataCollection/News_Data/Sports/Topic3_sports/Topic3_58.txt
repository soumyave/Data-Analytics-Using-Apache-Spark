In South Africa four years ago on their way to the final, they also swept all three of their games in the first round. But they have never been this productive in goal scoring this early: not in the days of Johan Cruyff and Total Football in the 1970s; not in the days of Dennis Bergkamp and Patrick Kluivert in 1998. The Dutch on Monday broke open a match against Chile that was long on full contact and short on open space in the 77th minute when Leroy Fer, a second-half substitute, took advantage of his first touch by scoring on a header from six yards out. The Dutch struck again in added time on a counterattack when Arjen Robben made just the right cross after a long run down the left wing and Memphis Depay, another second-half substitute, stabbed it into the net with his right foot.

We'll have a regular digest of news, highlights and context from Times reporters and editors.

Ten goals is not bad for a team that Chile’s coach, Jorge Sampaoli, said was only really interested in defending. Robben and Robin van Persie each have three goals, but Dutch Coach Louis van Gaal is also getting production from the new generation. The 20-year-old Depay has scored twice, and the 24-year-old Fer, who once considered representing the Netherlands Antilles, now has his first goal for the Netherlands. “You can say what you want, but a team who averages 3.3 goals a game is not really a defensive team,” said Dirk Kuyt, the Dutch veteran. “Chile wanted to attack us, but they didn’t create many chances, and in football, the most important thing is who creates the most chances and who scores the most goals. That’s what we did today. We know our qualities, and everyone knows how dangerous the Dutch team is up front.” Kuyt, it should be noted, did play much more defensively than usual: setting up in a left midfield position behind the forward line instead of at wing.

I’m a player with experience. I played in many positions during my career, and we played well, so hopefully I will get another chance at the position.” It was another reaffirming afternoon for van Gaal, a strong-minded tactician who will soon take over as the manager at Manchester United and who has mixed his lineups and timed his substitutions adroitly.

Credit Ivan Alvarado/Reuters    The only blemish was an ugly first half last week against Australia in Porto Alegre, but a second-half shift back to three forwards solved that riddle as the Dutch rallied to win, 3-2. On Monday, playing without the team captain van Persie, the suspended striker, van Gaal brought in Depay and then Fer at the right time, with Fer scoring two minutes after entering the game. “Well, that’s luck,” van Gaal said. “Of course I know Leroy Fer can kick far and can really move forward vis-à-vis the opponent. I know he’s a very good header of the ball, and that way you have an advantage against Chile. “And with Memphis, we analyzed that Chile always in the last 15 minutes give away more space, so if you field a very creative football player, you have a chance to cash in on those opportunities,” van Gaal added.

But then the Dutch are hardly at full strength without van Persie. His absence left the canvas clear for others: above all Robben, the 30-year-old winger who has been playing and dribbling like a Dutchman on a mission. “It’s a fantastic result and a fantastic performance,” Robben said of the Netherlands’ 3-0 start in what was supposed to be a brutal group. “But it shouldn’t end here.”   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   SPAIN 3, AUSTRALIA 0 Spain, the defending champion, salvaged some pride with a victory over Australia. After losing their previous matches in Group B, both teams took to Arena da Baixada in Curitiba knowing they could not advance to the second round. David Villa, on his 97th and final appearance, put Spain ahead in the 36th minute with his record 59th goal, guiding Juanfran’s pass into the net with the inside of his right foot. Fernando Torres steered the ball past Australia goalkeeper Maty Ryan in the 69th minute, and Juan Mata added the third in the 82nd from close range after he was found in space by Cesc Fàbregas.
