Max Kepler and Brian Dozier also went deep, Eduardo Escobar had five hits and two R.B.I., and Jason Castro had four hits and four R.B.I. for the Twins, who are in first place in the American League Central despite an A.L.-worst 13-19 record at home. The Twins’ 28 hits were the most in a game since the Texas Rangers had 29 in a 30-3 win over the Baltimore Orioles on Aug. 22, 2007.

Credit Etienne Laurent/European Pressphoto Agency    Ousmane Dembélé scored the winner as France overcame a red card for Raphaël Varane early in the second half to beat visiting England, 3-2, in a pulsating exhibition in St.-Denis on Tuesday. The teenage striker Kylian Mbappé set up Dembélé’s winner in the 78th minute with an astute pass, and the two caused problems for a patchy England defense all night with their electrifying speed and skill. It threatened to be another frustrating night for France at the hands of technology, with Varane sent off two minutes into the second half. The referee Davide Massa awarded a penalty kick after Varane fouled midfielder Dele Alli; after using the video referral system, he brandished the red card. England striker Harry Kane slammed home that penalty kick, in the 48th minute. In an emotional show of support for the victims of the recent attacks in Manchester and London, the players walked out to the sound of “Don’t Look Back in Anger” from Oasis. The pop anthem was played by the musicians and the choir of the French Republican Guard. JAPAN DRAWS; SOUTH KOREA LOSES Japan and South Korea dropped points in 2018 World Cup qualification in games that both teams were expected to win.

It said Ronaldo “took advantage of a business structure created in 2010 to hide from fiscal authorities income generated in Spain from image rights.” FORMER PLAYER TO LEAD ROMA The former Roma midfielder Eusebio Di Francesco will manage the team, the Serie A runner-up, ushering the Giallorossi into a new era after the retirement of the longtime captain Francesco Totti.

Documents filed on behalf of four of the players speak of alleged hazing of a freshman member of the team during a September visit to Rhode Island for a game against the United States Coast Guard Academy. Court papers involving a fifth player claim that student was not on the trip during which hazing might have occurred. Revelations involving the soccer team come as the military service academy, just outside New York City, struggles with allegations of sexual abuse, harassment and bullying. Last year, a program that places academy midshipmen on commercial vessels was temporarily suspended over concerns that students were being victimized. Representative Peter King, Republican of New York and chairman of the academy’s Board of Visitors, a congressional oversight panel, said he learned of the investigation involving the soccer team about 10 days ago.

Although he had off-season foot surgery leading into the 2016 season, Edelman appeared in all 16 regular-season games for just the second time.

REDSKINS TURN TO EX-QUARTERBACK The former Redskins quarterback Doug Williams was named Washington’s senior vice president for player personnel. Williams, 61, who has been in Washington’s front office since February 2014, got a promotion from senior personnel executive but did not want the general manager’s title. “We had a general manager — it didn’t work out that well,” Williams said, referring to the two-year tenure of Scot McCloughan, who was fired in March.
