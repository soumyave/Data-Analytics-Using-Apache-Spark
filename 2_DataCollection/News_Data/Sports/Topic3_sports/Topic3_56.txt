Credit Pool photo by Chris J Ratcliffe     Thank you to the 900 teenagers who participated in the fifth week of our 10-week Summer Reading Contest , and congratulations to Preanka P. , our winner, as well as to our many runners-up and honorable mentions. Scroll down to take a look at the variety of topics that caught the eyes of our participants, and remember: you can write about any of them, or anything else published on NYTimes.com in 2017, to join the contest yourself. Winner Preanka P., from New Jersey, chose the Op-Ed “ No, Jane Austen Is Not Your Besti e ” by Howard Jacobson, and wrote: I am exactly the obsessive “Janeite” Howard Jacobson criticizes in this article. When I see a headline toting Jane Austen’s name, I click on it faster than an Amazon shopper on Black Friday, eager to learn about the author’s life. While Jacobson calls for readers to stop personalizing Austen, I believe we can connect to the author and respect her legacy. Unlike other writers, Austen strayed from the pattern of swashbuckling knights and heroes to write about normal life. Readers dig into her past because her writing subject invites inquiry. We ask, why did she choose naturalism over fantasy? Did the pressure of gender stereotypes catapult her literary career?  Austen’s writing is memorable due to its shrewd word choice and signature wit. When we laugh at her humor, we acknowledge the writer’s humanity. Recognizing this, we seek to understand her life, just as the characters in her novels try to relate to one another.  Nevertheless, I agree with Jacobson’s criticism of those who refer to Jane Austen as “Jane.” We’re not calling the author over for a cup of tea. We should honor her memory with her last name, even in casual conversations.  On the 200th anniversary of Austen’s death, we must recognize her enduring impact on readers. Jane Austen is not a historical figure meant to be boxed away in a museum and admired from a distance. Living on as a writer, she still connects with her readers, even after her passing.
