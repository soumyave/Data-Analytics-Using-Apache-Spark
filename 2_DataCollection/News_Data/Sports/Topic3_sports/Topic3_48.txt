Credit Neil Hall/European Pressphoto Agency     LONDON — Chelsea let a two-goal lead disappear against Roma before recovering for a 3-3 tie in the Champions League on Wednesday as the Blues’ defensive vulnerability was exposed again. Following Premier League losses to Manchester City and struggling Crystal Palace, Chelsea, the defending English champion, salvaged a point after Eden Hazard headed in his second goal of the night in the 75th minute. Edin Dzeko scored twice, briefly putting Roma in front, but Chelsea remained two points ahead of the Italian club at the top of the group. Atlético Madrid is three points further back after being held to a scoreless tie by Qarabag, a newcomer to the competition from Azerbaijan that earned its first point in its third game. Chelsea had a blistering start at Stamford Bridge with David Luiz curling a shot into the bottom corner after 11 minutes. The lead was preserved by the right boot of goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, which denied Radja Nainggolan from close range.

Alvaro Morata was released down the left and the striker wove through the defense before a deflected shot landed at the feet of Hazard, who was primed to sweep the ball into the net.

In the 64th minute, Dzeko unleashed a first-time volley through Courtois’s arms after being set up by the former Tottenham defender Federico Fazio. Courtois was beaten again by Dzeko six minutes later as Kolarov and Dzeko combined. Dzeko darted into space between Chelsea defender to meet Kolarov’s free kick with a header. But Hazard came to Chelsea’s rescue when he headed in Pedro Rodriguez’s cross, and the hosts hung on for the point.
