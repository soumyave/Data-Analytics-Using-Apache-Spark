Credit Tom Brenner/The New York Times     WASHINGTON — President Trump attacked his own attorney general on Wednesday, asking in a Twitter post why Jeff Sessions has not been investigating Democrats for Russian interference in the 2016 election.

        Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Feb. 21, 2018     In his tweet, Mr. Trump revived his offensive on Mr. Sessions, whom he once called “beleaguered,” and continued his days-long Twitter comments on the ongoing special counsel’s investigation into Russian meddling .

The president has publicly said he never would have hired Mr. Sessions if he knew the attorney general would recuse himself from the Russia investigation. The attorney general’s recusal last year was the first in a series of steps that led to Mr. Mueller’s appointment . Mr. Trump had once considered firing Mr. Mueller , but he backed down after the objection of a senior adviser.
