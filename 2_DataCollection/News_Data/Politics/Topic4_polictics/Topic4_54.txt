Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times     Whatever you thought of President Trump’s first State of the Union address, one fact is indisputable: There was a lot of it.

In terms of word count, the longest spoken State of the Union in American history was Mr. Clinton’s 1995 address, at 9,190 words. Written State of the Union Messages — the norm until the early 20th century — were often much longer.  Continue reading the main story        We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
