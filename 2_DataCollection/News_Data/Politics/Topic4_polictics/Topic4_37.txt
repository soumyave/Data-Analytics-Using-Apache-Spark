William H. Pauley III, a judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in Manhattan, officiated. Dr. Shively, 34, is a medical toxicology fellow for Northwell Health, a hospital system based in Manhasset, N.Y., and an attending physician in emergency medicine at Elmhurst Hospital Center in Elmhurst, Queens. She graduated from Northwestern, and received a medical degree from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. From 2011 to 2013 she was a clinical scholar working on vaccine development at Rockefeller University, funded by a National Institutes of Health Clinical and Translational Science Award. She is the daughter of Susan M. Burkhalter and Curtis A. Shively of Bethesda, Md. Mr. Llewelyn, 33, is a lawyer at Lankler Siffert & Wohl in Manhattan. He graduated summa cum laude from the University of South Florida. He also received both a master’s degree in English and a law degree, summa cum laude, from Duke. From 2013 to 2014 he was a clerk for Neil M. Gorsuch, now an associate justice on the Supreme Court but then a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, in Denver. The groom is the son of Helen T. Lewis of Bradenton, Fla., and the late Gareth B. Jones, who lived in Capel Iwan, Wales.

They kissed good night after he walked her to the Astor Place subway station — he lived in Battery Park City and she on the Upper East Side — and a couple of weeks later the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy did not stand in the way of a second date at the Dead Poet bar in the West 70s. “The first big part of the journey I walked through Wall Street,” he said. “It was a ghost town. It was like a-last-man-on-earth kind of movie. I was able to get a cab on 30th Street. This time, I was 20 minutes late.” They began dating seriously, and soon got around to having lively political debates. “We’re both passionate about politics,” Dr. Shively said. “It’s a bane and a boon. We share core values. We’re not too different that we can’t relate to one another.”   A version of this article appears in print on March 11, 2018, on Page ST14 of the New York edition with the headline: Talking Rap With Obama, and Romney.
