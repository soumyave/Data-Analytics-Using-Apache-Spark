Facebook and Congress During Mark Zuckerberg’s congressional testimony this week, a senator told the Facebook chief executive that Congress’s power to regulate the company was heavily constrained by Facebook’s own lobbyists. On “The Daily Show” on Thursday, Trevor Noah commended the senator, John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, for his candor. But he lamented the idea that Congress could not be expected to make its own decisions, free of corporate influence. “So all lawmakers can really do is just chastise Facebook publicly and ask them nicely to go and think about what they’ve done. That’s all they can do. Basically, Congress has to deal with big corporations the way rich white people punish their kids. ‘Young man, there’s going to be consequences for this! Now you go to one of your bedrooms and figure out what the consequences should be. And give me your iPhone! Here’s the newer one.’” — TREVOR NOAH    Video by The Daily Show With Trevor Noah   Colbert Sings a Trump Version of ‘My Way’    Video by The Late Show With Stephen Colbert   In an interview with The Washington Post, a Republican strategist said, “Trump is truly serving as his own chief of staff, communications director and policy maven,” adding: “He’s singing the Frank Sinatra song, ‘I’ll do it my way.’”   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Stephen Colbert created a version of “My Way” tailored specifically to Trump. Regrets? Hey, what are those?  I barrel forth without reflection,  I do what I want to do,  Follow my gut and my erection.  For what is a man, what does he tweet,  Starting a war from his toilet seat?  To scream the things he truly feels,  Between rounds of golf and Happy Meals,  I’ll let my staff clean up the chaff  And do it Trump’s way! ‘Your Time Will Come, Nature’ Reports of egregious spending by Scott Pruitt, the head of the E.P.A., continue to mount . Late-night hosts kept their sights set on him Thursday night. “This man who’s supposed to be in charge of protecting our environment has relentlessly dismantled regulations that protect the environment. It’s almost like a bird pooped on his head when he was a kid, and ever since he’s been like, ‘Your time will come, nature.’” — JIMMY KIMMEL  “Among other things, Pruitt ‘regularly flies first class’ when his predecessors flew coach, and he wanted to spend ‘$70,000 to replace two desks in his office suite, one with a bulletproof model.’ And Pruitt had ‘round-the-clock security,’ costing nearly $3 million. One former co-worker said, ‘He wanted to be treated like he was the president.’ Well, now he’s under investigation — so congratulations, Scott, you made it!” — STEPHEN COLBERT, quoting from articles in The New York Times and  The Washington Post  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       The Punchiest Punchlines (Jager Bomb Edition)    Video by The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon   “President Trump was supposed to go to South America today, but he canceled and Mike Pence went instead. For South America it was like ordering a Jager Bomb then getting a Shirley Temple.” — JIMMY FALLON  “A former Playboy bunny just became the oldest lingerie model at 83 years old. When asked why she went back to work, she said, ‘My Trump hush money ran out.’” — JIMMY FALLON  “A new report did not name New York City as one of the 25 best places to live in the country. ‘I’m shocked,’ said an adult New Yorker with six roommates.” — SETH MEYERS The Bits Worth Watching If you cheat on the test by writing the answers on your hands, don’t wave to your teacher on the way out.    Video by The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon   On “The Opposition,” Kobi Libii confronted the conspiracy theorist and talk show host Alex Jones, accusing him of being a “crisis actor.”    Video by Comedy Central   Enjoy the Weekend The Times Late-Night Comedy Committee will be back on Tuesday. And that night, James Comey will sit down with Colbert to discuss his new tell-all book. Also, Check This Out  Photo         Credit Mark Peterson/Redux    Our chief book critic emeritus, Michiko Kakutani, made a brief return on Thursday to review Comey’s book . She calls it “absorbing” and says it “underscores just how outside presidential norms Trump’s behavior has been — how ignorant he is about his basic duties as president, and how willfully he has flouted the checks and balances that safeguard our democracy.”  Continue reading the main story        We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
