Comey, the former director of the F.B.I., in Washington last year during a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing. Though removed from public service, he remains intensely in the spotlight.   Credit Al Drago/The New York Times     When President Trump fired James B. Comey as the director of the F.B.I. last May, that did not mean the end of Mr. Comey’s time in the public eye — far from it. His memoir, “A Higher Loyalty,” is about to be released and Mr. Comey was featured in a wide-ranging interview with ABC News that aired on Sunday . While ABC broadcast an hour of its conversation with Mr. Comey, it conducted a five-hour interview with him, a transcript of which was obtained by The New York Times. In it, Mr. Comey called Mr. Trump a serial liar who treated women like “meat,” and described him as a “stain” on everyone who worked for him. [ Read more from The Times’s Michael D. Shear and Peter Baker and read annotated excerpts from the interview » ] An escalating feud For days, Mr. Trump has waged a ferocious counterattack against Mr. Comey, who portrays the president in his book as an unethical and dishonest leader. On Sunday morning, Mr. Trump unleashed a barrage of Twitter posts, calling Mr. Comey a liar and denying he had asked him for loyalty.   I never asked Comey for Personal Loyalty. I hardly even knew this guy. Just another of his many lies. His “memos” are self serving and FAKE! —
        Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 15, 2018     Mr. Trump suggested Mr. Comey should be jailed , accusing him of leaking classified information and lying to Congress. He referred to the Clinton email investigation , saying Mr. Comey “was making decisions based on the fact that he thought she was going to win, and he wanted a job.” He also called Mr. Comey a “slimeball” again, and said he had thrown the former attorney general, Loretta Lynch, “ under the bus .”   Slippery James Comey, a man who always ends up badly and out of whack (he is not smart!), will go down as the WORST FBI Director in history, by far! —

Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times    A letter to Congress, weeks before the election Mr. Comey made a fateful decision in October 2016, when he was the F.B.I. director. In a letter that was immediately made public ( you can read it here ), he told Congress the agency was reopening an investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails .  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       It was not standard protocol for the F.B.I. to make these kinds of announcements publicly. But Mr. Comey determined that this time was different , in part because he believed that failing to disclose the investigation could tarnish both the F.B.I. and the presidential election .     Graphic  These Are the Bad (and Worse) Options James Comey Faced  When federal officials concluded their investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server as secretary of state, the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, had a decision to make on how to announce that news. The choices he made in July set the F.B.I. on the path toward the predicament it faces today.         OPEN Graphic      Here is a deep dive into the back story of that decision, which may have contributed to Mr. Trump’s upset victory. An inauguration and a termination Here is a timeline of Mr. Comey’s short tenure as F.B.I. director under Mr. Trump. Mr. Comey met the president-elect for the first time in January 2017, during an intelligence briefing about Russian meddling in the election . In meetings and conversations afterward, Mr. Comey has said , the president tried in vain to secure his loyalty.  Photo        James Comey with President Trump at the White House in January 2017.

Credit Pool photo by Andrew Harrer    In March 2017, Mr. Comey confirmed that the F.B.I. was investigating Russian links to the Trump campaign . He later said the president repeatedly asked him to say publicly what he had said privately: that Mr. Trump was not personally under investigation . Two months later, Mr. Comey testified on Capitol Hill to defend reopening the Clinton investigation in 2016. A memorable quote: “It makes me mildly nauseous to think that we might have had some impact on the election.” On May 9, 2017, Mr. Trump fired Mr. Comey .

        James Comey (@Comey) Oct. 23, 2017     Mr. Trump grew bolder in criticizing Mr. Comey , calling him a “ showboat ,” a “ nut job ” and, more recently, an “ untruthful slime ball .” The president’s stated reasons for firing the F.B.I. director have been inconsistent .     Five Contradictions in the White House’s Story About Comey’s Firing  The Trump administration has offered conflicting answers about how and why the F.B.I. director, James Comey, was fired.             In June, Mr. Comey discussed the president at length at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing. It was quite an event . In testimony that was plain-spoken but forceful, he accused Mr. Trump of lying, defaming the F.B.I. and trying to derail an investigation .  Video   Highlights From Comey’s Testimony    James B.
