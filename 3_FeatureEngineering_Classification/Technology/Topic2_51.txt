Credit Jack Taylor/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images     Good Monday. Here’s what we’re watching: • The tech reckoning is gaining momentum. • Ripple’s XRP virtual currency plunged over the past day. • GoPro’s shares dropped after the company announced disappointing sales forecasts. • Could a sale of Twitter happen this year? Want this in your own email inbox ? Here’s the sign-up . The tech reckoning is gaining momentum. American technology giants are facing an increasing backlash. Google-parent Alphabet, Facebook and Twitter have drawn scrutiny from lawmakers over the manipulation of social media during the 2016 election by Russian operatives. Critics of Amazon say it is killing jobs. Across the pond, European regulators have gone after American tech firms over privacy and what officials deem anticompetitive behavior. Now Jana Partners and pension giant Calstrs are pushing Apple to do more to protect its youngest users from the effects of digital technology.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Writes Shira Ovide of Bloomberg Gadfly: “One letter from Calstrs and Jana may amount to nothing. It’s becoming increasingly clear, however, that scrutiny over technology companies and their products isn’t going away.  “There will be much discussion about whether technology companies, or people and parents, bear responsibility for limiting the harmful effects of technology. Even smartphone overuse isn’t Apple’s problem alone. Its gadgets are gateways to people hooked on Instagram, YouTube, Snapchat and much more. We are all the problem, and the technology companies are all the problem.” Still, compared to Facebook, Google or Snap, Apple is an unusual choice for the investors to target, writes Jennifer Saba of Breakingviews . The company makes hardware and uses privacy as a selling point. For those reasons, Apple was expected to avoid the worst of the blowback . But its targeting shows the extent to which the backlash against tech is gaining momentum: Writes Ms. Saba: “Silicon Valley used to enjoy an exalted status, but questions about the role of social media in the 2016 presidential election and the way digital technologies may threaten jobs and promote monopolies are breeding skepticism. The new focus on Apple shows how much technology has lost its halo.” Rick Perry’s Plan to Rescue Struggling Coal and Nuclear Plants Is Rejected Federal regulators have rejected a proposal by Energy Secretary Rick Perry to subsidize struggling coal and nuclear plants, in a major blow to the Trump administration’s efforts to revive America’s declining coal industry, the NYT reports . In September, Mr. Perry warned that the loss of these plants could threaten the “reliability and resiliency of our nation’s grid” and asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which oversees regional electricity markets, to guarantee financial returns for power plants that can stockpile at least 90 days’ worth of fuel on-site — which, in effect, meant propping up uncompetitive coal and nuclear units. (Natural gas plants are typically fed by pipeline and would not qualify.)  While a few utilities with significant coal and nuclear capacity supported the idea, Mr. Perry’s proposal generated a fierce backlash from a broad coalition of energy companies, free-market groups and former regulators.

Only last week, Ripple appeared to lay claim to the biggest alternative to Bitcoin. That isn’t the case anymore. The price of Ripple’s XRP virtual currency has plunged about 27 percent over the past 24 hours, reaching $2.47 this morning, according to CoinMarketCap. Ripple’s total market capitalization has fallen back below that of Ethereum. To be fair, other virtual currencies — including Bitcoin — are falling as well. It was only last week: Investors breathlessly touted Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen, who owns a significant amount of XRP, as richer than Mark Zuckerberg . The breathlessness hasn’t abated: Shares in Seagate were briefly up more than 10 percent on Monday amid excited speculation that the hard drive company owned a huge stake in XRP as part of its investment in Ripple almost three years ago. (It’s not clear that’s actually the case.) — Michael J. de la Merced                GoPro’s woes continue to grow. Its announcement of preliminary fourth-quarter results today compounds the troubles for what has been one of the most disappointing market debutantes in recent years. The company issued a revenue forecast that was lighter than analysts were expecting. And the action-camera maker announced its latest efforts to turn around its business: • Laying off at least 254 employees, bringing its headcount to under 1,000 worldwide • Its founder and C.E.O., Nick Woodman, reducing his cash compensation this year to $1. • Getting out of the drone market amid “a hostile regulatory environment” in Europe and the U.S.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Over all, GoPro’s shares have fallen 79 percent since the company’s I.P.O. three-and-a-half years ago. — Michael J. de la Merced How much of its tax windfall will Apple spend on buybacks? Steven Milunovich, an analyst at UBS, expects the iPhone maker to use the overseas cash it repatriates to buy back $122 billion in stock through 2019. The company holds about $252 billion cash offshore. Mr. Milunovich via CNBC writes : “Repatriation of ~$250bn of offshore cash should increase the rate of Apple’s share buybacks since the company believes the stock remains attractive in that its services business is undervalued.” Apple has bought back more than $165 billion of stock over the past five years.  Photo         Credit Jason Henry for The New York Times    Is 2018 the year that Twitter is sold? The analyst Rich Greenfield of BTIG thinks so. Leading his list of predictions for the year is speculation that the social network would finally become the target of deal-making . (Remember that Salesforce had held talks to buy the company in the fall of 2016.) From Mr. Greenfield’s note: Twitter offers a unique acquisition opportunity for any company looking to own breaking news, politics and sports, infused with video on mobile devices with tens of millions of daily active users across the world. Add to that a vast treasure trove of data on its users and a Twitter acquisition becomes compelling for many companies across the TMT universe. Who would buy Twitter? Maybe Salesforce comes back. Or maybe Google does. Or Microsoft. Other predictions • AT&T will defeat the Justice Department in the court battle over Time Warner. • CBS and Viacom finally combine. • Spotify will go public this year, but may sell itself down the road. — Michael J. de la Merced How long can Nvidia’s rally last? The chip-maker’s stock is up 2.5 percent Monday. The driver? News that Nvidia will partner with Uber and Volkswagen on autonomous driving projects. Reuters reports : • “Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said at the CES technology conference in Las Vegas that Uber’s self-driving car fleet was using their technology to help its autonomous cars perceive the world and make split-second decisions.” • “With Volkswagen, Nvidia said it was infusing its artificial intelligence technology into the German automakers’ future lineup, using their new Drive IX platform. The technology will enable so-called “intelligent co-pilot” capabilities based on processing sensor data inside and outside the car.”   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Some context: Shares of Nvidia more than doubled over the past 12 months after a roughly 200 percent gain in 2016. The rally in Nvidia’s shares has come as demand for chips to power data centers, artificial intelligence, autonomous driving and gaming has surged. Nvidia said that “320 companies involved in self-driving cars - whether software developers, automakers and their suppliers, sensor and mapping companies - are using Nvidia Drive, formerly branded as the Drive PX2,” Reuters reports. Deutsche Bank’s woes continue. The German bank is down seven percent the past two days after it said it would post a small loss for 2017, its third consecutive annual. Weak trading and a $1.8 billion hit from the United State’s tax overhaul are the main culprits. Of those, Deutsche Bank’s trading woes should be more concerning to shareholders, writes Christopher Thompson of Breakingviews . The bank said sales and trading revenue was expected to decline 22 percent in the fourth quarter from a year ago. While Deutsche Bank’s trading performance has not be appreciably worse than its European rivals, the decline in its shares “is that it is more dependent on this revenue than other big investment banks.” “Equities and fixed income sales and trading brought in more than 31 percent of Deutsche’s total revenue in the third quarter of 2017, compared with around 28 percent at Credit Suisse and 19 percent at Barclays. The German group also lacks a consistent source of stable earnings similar to Credit Suisse’s wealth management franchise or Barclays’s UK retail bank.” That means that “without a pickup in volatility or client activity, trading revenues – and shareholders – remain stuck in a rut,” Mr. Thompson writes.

Credit Rebecca Butala How/Getty Images    If your business flight to New York was disrupted this weekend, here’s why. Jason Rabinowitz of The Points Guy explained how John F. Kennedy International Airport in particular functions — and why its operations were severely disrupted even after the “bomb cyclone” of last week. Among the interesting pieces of trivia to emerge from the piece: Essentially, each terminal at JFK is its own little fiefdom with separate operations, management and employees. If an airline calls Terminal 7 home, that’s the only terminal it’s allowed to use. Even if Terminal 4 has a dozen empty gates, an airline slated for Terminal 7 may have to wait hours for a gate to open at Terminal 7. Here’s Mr. Rabinowitz’s concluding thought: Savvy travelers all know to avoid NYC area airports whenever possible, and this winter storm drove that point home once again. — Michael J. de la Merced  Photo         Credit Mike Blake/Reuters    Intel’s C.E.O. is in the hot seat, just in time for CES. Questions Brian Krzanich is likely to face about as he prepares for a keynote speech at the biggest convention in consumer electronics: • How well will planned fixes work against Meltdown and Spectre, the two computer chip security flaws that affect most of the world’s processors?   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   • Can Intel design new chips without either of the problems? • Were the $39 million worth of stock sales he made in November, after the flaws were discovered but before they were disclosed, really just part of a prearranged trading plan? What he would prefer to talk about: Augmented reality and self-driving cars. Today’s talking point, from Nathaniel Fick, the C.E.O. of the cybersecurity company Endgame, in an NYT Op-Ed : From a corporate governance and accountability perspective, cybersecurity today is being treated like accounting was before the fallout from the Enron scandal inspired the Sarbanes-Oxley Act’s increased standards for corporate disclosures .

Revelations about more ties between the Kushner Companies and Israeli businesses like the insurer Menora Mivtachim have raised questions about Jared Kushner’s wealth and the complicated relationships that his family’s company has around the world. (Particularly given Mr. Kushner’s role as a top envoy for Middle Eastern peace, as well as a senior adviser in his father-in-law’s White House.) Caveat: The NYT says that recent deals don’t appear to violate federal ethics laws, and Mr. Kushner appears not to have been personally involved. He has sold stakes in some Kushner Companies properties, like the 666 Fifth Avenue office building in Midtown Manhattan. The pull quote , from Robert Weissman of the nonprofit government ethics group Public Citizen: “No one could ever imagine this scale of ongoing business interests, not in a local peanut farm or a hardware store but sprawling global businesses that give the president and his top adviser personal economic stakes in an astounding number of policy interests.” The Washington flyaround • Steve Bannon has backed away from remarks quoted in “Fire and Fury,” Michael Wolff’s book on the Trump White House.

Mr. Trump will head to Tennessee today to promote the tax overhaul. But the farm industry has reason to dislike some of his economic policies. From Ana Swanson and Jim Tankersley of the NYT: New analyses of the tax law by economists at the Department of Agriculture suggest it could actually lower farm output in the years to come and effectively raise taxes on the lowest-earning farm households, while delivering large gains for the richest farmers. An industry breathing a sigh of relief: Analysts expect a tax windfall for retailers, especially domestically focused ones like Nordstrom and those targeting high-end consumers, according to the WSJ.

Who’s helping Jana: The big California pension fund known as Calstrs . Also on board as advisers are the musician Sting and his wife, Trudie Styler ; Sister Patricia Daly , a nun who took on Exxon Mobil over environmental issues; and Robert Eccles , a sustainability expert. The bigger picture: Jana is wading into corporate social responsibility , an area that Wall Street has only recently started dabbling in, the WSJ reports. Firms like TPG have raised social impact funds, but no major activist fund has started campaigns focused specifically on getting companies to act better from a social standpoint.  Photo        Why Warren Buffett is optimistic about the U.S. He explains with some math in this week’s Time , guest-edited by Bill Gates: • America’s population should grow by about 0.8 percent a year, between births and immigration. • Assuming annual gains in real GDP continue to be about 2 percent, that means the U.S. will deliver about 1.2 percent growth in per-capita GDP. What that means in real terms: In 25 years, GDP per head would go from $52,000 to $79,000 . The pull quote: This game of economic miracles is in its early innings. Americans will benefit from far more and better “stuff” in the future. The challenge will be to have this bounty deliver a better life to the disrupted as well as to the disrupters. And on this matter, many Americans are justifiably worried.
