The chipmaker's forecast for current-quarter revenue also exceeded expectations, and AMD's shares jumped more than 9 percent in after-hours trading on Wednesday. The stock has climbed over 250 percent in the past two years as the Santa Clara, California-based company benefits from demand for graphics chips used in computers, videogame consoles and for a variety of other applications. To tap rising demand for chips from data centers, AMD has also developed newer editions of server processors.

Still, gaming would continue to be a "top priority" for the company, Su said. AMD reported a net income of $81 million in the three months ended March 31, compared with a net loss of $33 million a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, AMD earned 11 cents per share, ahead of analysts' average estimate of 9 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue jumped 40 percent to $1.65 billion, topping expectations of $1.57 billion as sales at its key computing and graphics business nearly doubled. AMD expects current-quarter revenue of $1.73 billion, give or take $50 million, while analysts were expecting revenue of $1.57 billion.
