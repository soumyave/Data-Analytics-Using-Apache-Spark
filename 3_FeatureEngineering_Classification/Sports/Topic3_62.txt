Living In Ardsley, N.Y.   Credit Gregg Vigliotti for The New York Times           Steve Dumas, 35, and his wife, Suzanne, 36, were renting an apartment in Tarrytown last year and looking for a house with “enough space so we didn’t have to move in a few years,” said Mr. Dumas, who is the senior director of strategy for a startup in Midtown Manhattan . They also had a bit of a deadline: Ms. Dumas, a social worker for Montefiore Medical Center, was pregnant with their first child. A former colleague of Mr. Dumas’s lived in Ardsley, N.Y., and recommended the village to them. Mr. Dumas, who grew up in Rockland County, had also heard good things about the school system. The couple closed last spring on a three-bedroom three-bath ranch near the elementary school, paying $650,000, and moved into it in June. It’s just a short walk to get coffee or get onto a hiking trail, they said, and they already have a future friend in mind for their son, Quinn, who was born in August — Mr. Dumas’s former colleague gave birth to a baby boy in May. “We picked a good time to come,” Mr. Dumas said. The village of one square mile, part of the town of Greenburgh, has managed to retain its small-town appeal over the years despite the slicing in half of its business district by the construction of the Gov. Thomas E. Dewey Thruway in the 1950s. It is a community where residents “care a lot for each other,” said Lauren Allan, the superintendent of the Ardsley school district, who moved to the village with her family when she was 12.

Francie Malina, an agent with Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage in Dobbs Ferry, said a majority of her clients are young families from Manhattan, Brooklyn and Long Island City, Queens , looking for a “low-key lifestyle” who may not have the budget for Scarsdale or Bronxville. “You can get a lot of house for the price in Ardsley,” she said. An easy commute to Midtown Manhattan is a big draw, agents and buyers say, but traffic can be a problem. To help with that, traffic lanes are being added and widened in the business district, and there are plans to replace the Ashford Avenue Bridge linking the village to Dobbs Ferry, said Meredith S. Robson, the Ardsley village manager.  Photo        3 Farm Road A four-bedroom three-bath contemporary on 1.09 acres, listed at $945,000.

Joyce Tandlich, 90, an antiques dealer and former teacher, has seen a lot of changes since arriving in Ardsley more than 60 years ago. There are more houses and more traffic, she said, but she still loves what drew her family to the village in the first place. “Once you’re here, you’re in the country,” she said, “but you can get in the car and you’re in the city.” What You’ll Find Ardsley is a village of about 4,450 people within the Town of Greenburgh, about 22 miles from New York City . Housing stock isvaried, with split levels, Capes and ranches predominating. Older homes near the center of the village are generally on quarter-acre lots, while newer, larger homes farther from the center are on larger lots, said Pamela Moss, an agent with Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage in Dobbs Ferry.

The Waterwheel Condominium , an affordable housing development, is nearing completion on Saw Mill River Road. Five of the 22 two- and three-bedroom units are earmarked for village employees, said Ardsley Mayor Peter R. Porcino.

Tomasso, the village building inspector.

Data from the Hudson Gateway Multiple Listing Service provided by Ms. Moss of Coldwell Banker showed the median sales price of a single-family home or condominium for the 12-month period ending Oct. 2 was $650,000, unchanged from the same period a year earlier. The Schools Roughly 2,100 students are in the Ardsley school system, which also includes students from areas of Dobbs Ferry, Irvington and unincorporated Greenburgh. The elementary school has about 750 pupils in kindergarten to fourth grade; the middle school, around 660 in fifth to eighth grades; and the high school, about 660 pupils in Grades 9 to 12.

Private schools include a campus of the Lyceum Kennedy French American School , for those in nursery school to the fifth grade. The Commute There is no Metro-North Railroad station in Ardsley, so residents use the Dobbs Ferry station on the Hudson Line, or the Scarsdale or Hartsdale stations on the Harlem Line. Travel times to Grand Central Terminal from all three stations range roughly from 31 to 54 minutes. Ticket prices are the same from all three stations, with monthly passes at $259; round-trip tickets at peak time, $23.50; off-peak, $17.50.

B. Wilbur McDowell Park on Heatherdell Road has several baseball diamonds, a basketball court and an area for picnicking. There is also an entrance on Saw Mill River Road to V. Everit Macy Park , a 172-acre park that is overseen by Westchester County. Social and recreational programs are offered at the Thelma Zimmer-William Van Dorn Youth and Community Center on Center Street. Residents can pay to swim in the indoor pool at the middle school during the school year, and at the Ardsley Swim and Tennis Club , a cooperative on Sprain Road, during the summer. Along Route 9A — also known as Saw Mill River Road — are several strip malls featuring cleaners, banks, restaurants and pharmacies. A new eatery, the Ardsley Diner , opened in August. The Riviera Bakehouse is known beyond the village for its whimsical birthday cakes. DeCicco & Sons , on Center Street off 9A, is a stop for many looking for fresh produce and groceries. The History First inhabited by the Weckquaesgeek Indians, a tribe related to the Mohicans, the Village was called Saw Mill Corners by its early European residents. According to Walter Schwartz, the village historian and village justice, it became Ashford in 1841, named for the British homeland of the owner of its largest business, a pickle factory. It changed to Ardsley in 1883 — again named for the ancestral homeland of a prominent businessman — when it was discovered that an Ashford post office already existed. The village incorporated in 1896. A devastating fire in 1914 led to the rebuilding of its business district.   For weekly email updates on residential real estate news, sign up here .
