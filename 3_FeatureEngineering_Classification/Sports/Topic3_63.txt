Credit Kirsten Luce for The New York Times     Plans to transform Willets Point, a crumbling collection of auto repair shops on 62 acres next to Citi Field in Queens, into a bustling neighborhood with a hotel, office space, housing and a large mall, have followed a tortuous path over the past decade. In early June, the development hit a roadblock when a state court ruled that New York City could not use a parking lot next to the stadium for the planned one-million-square-foot mall. The project suffered another setback on Wednesday, as negotiations broke down between the city and the developers that had been selected by the Bloomberg administration to build the project. The developers, Related Companies and Sterling Equities, filed an appeal on Wednesday, the deadline for asking the Court of Appeals, the state’s highest court, to overturn the lower court decision.

His administration’s decision to stay out of court undermines the developer’s attempt to overturn the lower court ruling, which concerns a city action .

The redevelopment plan has long been criticized by landowners in Willets Point, parks advocates, local residents and community groups as a generous deal for developers. In recent weeks, the city tried to improve the terms of the existing development deal, asking that the developers commit to accelerating the construction of affordable housing. Under the terms of the current agreement, the developers would first clean up environmental damage at Willets Point and build the mall next to the stadium with 200 stores, a theater and a small hotel, in 2018. The developers had agreed to also build 2,500 apartments, including 875 apartments for low- and moderate-income families, starting in 2025, although they had the option of paying the city $35 million to get out of that obligation. The developers said Wednesday that they remained committed to the redevelopment of Willets Point and were confident that their appeal would be successful. “We support the administration’s efforts on affordable housing and are committed to significantly accelerating the housing portion of this plan,” Phil Singer, a spokesman for the developers, said. “But those efforts need to be backed by a financially viable model. We look forward to working with the administration over the next few months.” Deputy Mayor Alicia Glen, however, said the city needed more promised for its investment of nearly a half-billion dollars than a shopping mall before it would have agreed to an appeal.

We hope that this team will continue to work toward that goal with us.” Related and Sterling Equities were not opposed to accelerating the construction of affordable housing. The developers recently proposed allowing a professional soccer club — New York City F.C. — that has been looking for a permanent home to build a soccer stadium next to Citi Field in return for a housing fund.

City Councilwoman Julissa Ferreras-Copeland, a Democrat who has supported the project from the beginning, still hoped that the two sides would come together. “My community urgently needs affordable housing, jobs and transportation enhancements,” Ms. Ferreras-Copeland said. “I have been working to this end, to improve Willets Point for the past eight years. We cannot wait any longer. I will work with all the parties to find an equitable solution.” Willets Point has long been regarded as an eyesore, a chicken coop for the auto industry, with makeshift auto body shops jammed up against muffler, auto glass, scrap metal and rim shops on a collection of broken streets that were often under water when it rained. But the area attracted motorists from as far as Westchester County and Long Island in search of a good deal at shops that employed hundreds of people. In 2007, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, a political independent, announced plans to turn Willets into New York’s “next great neighborhood,” a $3 billion development with 5,500 apartments, a convention center and office space. Some property owners in the Willets area opposed the development and condemnation of their land. Four developers competed for the project, but ultimately none of them could meet the city’s requirements without huge subsidies from the city.

Katz, who also own the Mets and Citi Field. Community and church groups who had supported the Bloomberg project because of the need for housing in the area, particularly affordable housing, were dismayed that the development had become centered on a shopping mall, while new apartments were shunted off until at least the middle of the next decade. Today, many of the shops in Willets Point are shuttered, with fresh graffiti scrawled across their metal gates. Business is slow at the stores that are open on Willets Point Boulevard, a dusty, potholed street. Miguel Ortiz, who moved to New York from Ecuador, opened his place, Gonzalez Muffler Auto Mechanic Shop, 10 years ago with his uncle Raphael Gonzalez. He said he worked seven days a week in the cramped, single-bay shop with three workers. Last week, he and other shop owners got a 30-day eviction notice from the city, as it continues to make room for Related’s project. “This was my dream,” Mr. Ortiz said, “to open a shop in the United States. “It was so busy before. Now, I’m really scared. I don’t have the money to move.”   A version of this article appears in print on August 20, 2015, on Page A19 of the New York edition with the headline: City Declines to Fight in Court for Land Deal in Stadium’s Shadow.
